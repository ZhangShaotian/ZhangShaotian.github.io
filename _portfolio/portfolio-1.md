I'm thrilled to share with you a groundbreaking project I led at VIA Tech, where we pushed the boundaries of automotive safety through the integration of a cost-effective radar sensor into our advanced driver recorder system. Our goal was to enhance visibility in hard-to-see areas, such as car trunks, without relying on expensive Controller Area Network (CAN) systems.

## Leveraging the LIN Protocol
We made a strategic decision to utilize the Local Interconnect Network (LIN) protocol for our radar sensor integration. This choice allowed us to:
- Achieve cost-effectiveness without compromising on performance
- Seamlessly interface with the driver recorder's RS232 interface
- Demonstrate the versatility and potential of the LIN protocol in automotive applications

## Cross-functional Collaboration
One of the key aspects of this project was the close collaboration between various teams. I worked hand-in-hand with:
- Layout design teams to create a custom circuit board
- 3D printing experts to develop an outer shell for the transition box
- Firmware engineers to ensure smooth communication between the radar sensor and the driver recorder

This cross-functional approach was crucial in delivering a solution that met all the technical requirements while remaining cost-effective.

## Designing the Transition Box
To bridge the gap between the driver recorder's RS232 interface and the LIN-based radar sensor, we designed a custom transition box. This involved:
- Drafting initial integration plans and selecting crucial components
- Designing a custom circuit board to house the necessary electronics
- Developing an outer shell using 3D printing technology to provide a robust enclosure  

The transition box played a vital role in ensuring seamless communication between the two systems, enabling the radar sensor to provide enhanced visibility data to the driver recorder.

## Enhancing Automotive Safety
The successful integration of the radar sensor into the driver recorder system has significant implications for automotive safety. By improving visibility in hard-to-see areas, we:

- Reduce the risk of accidents caused by blind spots
- Provide drivers with a more comprehensive understanding of their surroundings
- Demonstrate VIA Tech's commitment to innovation and safety in the automotive industry

This project not only showcases my technical expertise in radar sensor integration and the LIN protocol but also highlights my ability to lead cross-functional teams and deliver cost-effective solutions that have a real impact on automotive safety.
