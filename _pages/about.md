Hello! I'm Winchester(Shaotian) Zhang. I chose my preferred name "Winchester" inspired by two brave brothers in "[Supernatural](https://www.netflix.com/title/70143825){:target="_blank"}," a long-running American TV series. "Saving people, hunting things, the family business."

As an aspiring researcher in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), I am deeply engaged in the dynamic field of EECS, with a strong educational foundation and practical experience in CPU Architecture and Hardware Acceleration.

My journey includes significant experience in scientific computing. I served as a Computational Research Assistant in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University, under the supervision of [Prof. David Lee Hysell](https://www.eas.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/david-lee-hysell){:target="_blank"}. My focus was on exploring the feasibility of automatically solving ray tracing problems in Earth's ionosphere model, essentially enabling numerous mathematical problems to run automatically and more efficiently. Specifically, I concentrated on applying Automatic Differentiation to Partial Differential Equations(PDEs).

I am also interested in CPU architecture, including everything from front-end Register-Transfer Level (RTL) design to back-end physical design. My curiosity extends to understanding the intricate details of data flow within chips and how various metrics, such as energy, time, and area, are influenced. Currently, I am focusing on the physical implementation of the TSMC 28nm Low-Power Quad-Core A7, particularly its top hierarchical flow.
