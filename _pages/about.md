Hello! I'm Winchester(Shaotian) Zhang. I chose my preferred name "Winchester" inspired by two brave brothers in "Supernatural," a long-running American TV series. "Saving people, hunting things, the family business."

As an aspiring researcher in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), I am deeply engaged in the dynamic field of EECS, with a strong educational foundation and practical experience in CPU Architecture and Hardware Acceleration.

My journey includes significant experience in scientific computing. I served as a Computational Research Assistant in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University, under the supervision of Prof. David Lee Hysell. My focus was on exploring the feasibility of automatically solving real ray tracing problems in Earth's ionosphere model, essentially enabling numerous mathematical problems to run automatically and more efficiently. Specifically, I concentrated on applying Automatic Differentiation to Ray Tracing Problems in Radio Wave Propagation.

I am interested in CPU architecture, including everything from front-end Register-Transfer Level (RTL) design to back-end physical design. My curiosity extends to understanding the intricate details of data flow within chips and how various metrics, such as energy, time, and area, are influenced. Currently, I am focusing on the physical implementation of the TSMC 28nm Low-Power Quad-Core A7, particularly its top hierarchical flow.
