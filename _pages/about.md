Hello! I'm Winchester Zhang, I choose my preferred name "Winchester" based on the name of two brave brothers in one of the longest TV series in America "Supernatural", "saving people, hunting things, the family business".

I'm an aspiring ECE researcher. With a robust educational background and hands-on experience in cutting-edge technologies, I am passionately navigating the evolving landscapes of EECS.

I have extensive research experience, including internships in the Computer Systems Lab (CSL) at Cornell (advised by Prof. Udit Gupta), Intelligence Transportation Systems Lab at Continental AG, Research Team at Boston Consulting Group, Tech Team at Sequoia Capital, and Mask Network.

As the maintainer of HPCConf.xyz, I offer a streamlined tool for tracking key academic conference deadlines in the High Performance Computing field, supporting the HPC research community with timely and centralized information.
